  <p>
    Controls the verbosity of file operation logging during checkout.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Checked (default):</strong> Shows detailed logs for each file operation (NEW file: filename.txt, MODIFIED file: filename.txt, etc.) plus a summary.</li>
    <li><strong>Unchecked:</strong> Shows only a concise summary of processed files (e.g., "Processed 15 files (12 new, 2 modified, 1 deleted)").</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    For builds processing many files, unchecking this option makes build logs much more readable.
